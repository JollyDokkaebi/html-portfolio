<h1>Personal Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Of All Time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Spider-Man 2</h3>
<p>For it's time it was a marvel in CGI and script writing, perfectly encapsulating Peter Parkers Character.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Edward Norton was a Perfect Unreliable Narrarator, I loved the Twist at the end as everything came together. Revolutionized Story telling.</p>

<h3>Iron-Man</h3>
<p>A movie very close to my heart, it's arguably the father of Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
